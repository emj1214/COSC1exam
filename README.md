# COSC1exam
This is my submission for the COSC1 Placement Exam

I created the github file this morning before opening the exam around 10:30ish
At 4:00 I started my exam
At 4:38 I took a short pause to find my laptop charger and share some choice words about my computer's poor battery life 
At 4:53 I resumed work
At 5:02 I finished proof-reading and adding to comments to make everything somewhat coherent
*snack break*
At 5:52, after chatting with my roommate because I got distracted, I pushed this file to github and submitted my work
